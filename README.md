The aim of this project is to learn the basics of 2D game development.
In this 2D game, we have to create a map, 
  manage collisions with walls and check whether the map can be completed and whether the player is alone with one or more items to collect.
For this project, we need to learn how to use minilibX, the graphics library from 42 school.
